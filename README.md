  - Contact section: Provides my contact information and a contact form for viewers to get in touch with me.

## Future Development Plans

Although the app is functioning properly, I plan to make further improvements in the near future. These include:

- Include a demo walkthrough video on the project details page to provide a better understanding of each project.
- Continuously improve the UI/UX based on user feedback to enhance the overall user experience and visual appeal.
- Add a blog section to share my thoughts and insights on the frontend development topics and trends.
