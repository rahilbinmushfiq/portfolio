  - Contact section: Provides my contact information and a contact form for viewers to get in touch with me.
- Project-details page: A dynamic page that displays the details of a project based on the URL parameter. Each project has its own unique page, accessible through the project list on the Portfolio section of homepage. It includes:
  - Brief summary of the selected project.

## Future Development Plans

- Include a demo walkthrough video on the project details page to provide a better understanding of each project.
- Continuously improve the UI/UX based on user feedback to enhance the overall user experience and visual appeal.
- Add a blog section to share my thoughts and insights on the web development topics and trends.
